# "Elevate" Landing Page - Project & Sprints Overview

**Project Goal:** To develop a fully responsive, professional, and production-ready landing page for the "Elevate" application. The project is built using a modern frontend stack (React and Vite) with an emphasis on clean, maintainable code through the use of CSS Modules and a component-based architecture.

The development process is broken down into four distinct, logical sprints, progressing from foundational setup to final deployment preparation.

### **Sprint #01: Project Foundation & Initial Setup**

**Focus:** Establishing the technical groundwork and development environment.

**Overview:** This initial sprint is dedicated to setting up the project from scratch. It involves initializing a new Vite + React project with TypeScript, installing all necessary dependencies (like React Router and Axios), and creating a clean, scalable folder structure to organize assets, components, pages, services, and styles. A key deliverable is the creation of a global styling system in `theme.css`, which defines all core design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) as CSS variables, ensuring a consistent design language can be applied throughout the application.

### **Sprint #02: Component Development & Page Assembly**

**Focus:** Building the visual structure and static styling of the entire landing page.

**Overview:** In this phase, the focus shifts to translating the visual design of "Elevate's" landing page into functional React components. Each distinct section of the page (Header, Hero, Core Principles/Features, "Insight Catalyst" Highlight, Testimonials) is built as an individual, reusable component with its own JSX for structure and a scoped CSS Module for styling. The goal is to build out the static desktop version of the page, assembling all the newly created components in the main `LandingPage.jsx` file to form a complete, cohesive view.

### **Sprint #03: Responsive Design & Mobile Optimization**

**Focus:** Ensuring the landing page is fully functional and visually appealing on all device sizes, particularly tablets and mobile phones.

**Overview:** This sprint is dedicated to making the static desktop landing page fully responsive. Using CSS media queries within each component's `.module.css` file, the layout is adapted for smaller viewports. Two-column layouts are converted to single-column stacks, font sizes are scaled down appropriately, and spacing is adjusted to ensure readability and usability on tablets and mobile phones. The final deliverable is a single, fully responsive webpage that provides a great user experience on any device.

### **Sprint #04: Finalization, Accessibility & Build Preparation**

**Focus:** Polishing the application, ensuring it is accessible to all users, and preparing it for deployment.

**Overview:** This final sprint takes the completed, responsive landing page and makes it production-ready. All placeholder content (text and images) is replaced with the final assets. A thorough accessibility (a11y) audit is conducted to add semantic HTML tags, descriptive `alt` text for all images, proper form labels, and clear keyboard focus states. Assets are optimized for performance (e.g., image compression), and the codebase is cleaned of any development logs or comments. The sprint concludes with generating a final production build, resulting in optimized static files ready for hosting on a web server.
