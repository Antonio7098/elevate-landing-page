# **Sprint #02: Component Development & Page Assembly**

**Date Range:** 09 June 2025 - 13 June 2025
**Primary Focus:** Frontend - Component Scaffolding & Styling
**Overview:** This sprint focuses on building all the visual sections (components) of the "Elevate" landing page. Each component will be created with its own dedicated JSX for structure and a CSS Module for scoped styling, using the established clean and purposeful design aesthetic. The final task is to assemble these components into a single, cohesive page view.
