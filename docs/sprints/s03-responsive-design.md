# Sprint #03: Responsive Design & Mobile Optimization

**Date Range:** 16 June 2025 - 18 June 2025
**Primary Focus:** Frontend - CSS Media Queries & Mobile-First Adjustments
**Overview:** This sprint is dedicated to making the landing page fully responsive. The primary goal is to ensure the layout, typography, and usability are excellent on all common screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones. This will be achieved by adding media queries to each component's CSS module.

## I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List

*Instructions for the engineer: For each task, you will be editing the existing `.module.css` file for the specified component. The main breakpoint to target for major layout changes will be `768px` (standard tablet). You may need to add another for smaller mobile phones (e.g., `480px`) for finer adjustments.*

- [ ] **Task 1: Add a General Responsive Rule**
    - [ ] **Sub-task 1.1:** In `src/styles/global.css`, add a rule to make all images responsive by default. This prevents them from overflowing their containers.
    ```css
    img {
      max-width: 100%;
      height: auto;
      display: block;
    }
    ```

- [ ] **Task 2: Make the `Header` Component Responsive**
    - [ ] **Sub-task 2.1:** Open `src/components/Header/Header.module.css`.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 2.2:** Add a media query for screens `768px` or less.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 2.3:** Inside the query, target the main header class. Change its `flex-direction` to `column` to stack the logo and navigation. Add a `gap` to create space between the stacked items.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 2.4:** Target the navigation links (`.navLinks ul`) and change their `flex-direction` to `column` as well, ensuring they are centered.

- [ ] **Task 3: Make the `Hero` Component Responsive**
    - [ ] **Sub-task 3.1:** Open `src/components/Hero/Hero.module.css`.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 3.2:** Add a media query for screens `768px` or less.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 3.3:** Target the main grid container (`.heroContainer`). Change the `grid-template-columns` from `1fr 1fr` to `1fr` to stack the text and image columns.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 3.4:** Add `text-align: center;` to the container to center the headline and paragraph when stacked. Adjust padding for mobile.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 3.5:** Decrease the `font-size` of the `h1` (`--font-size-h1`) on smaller screens to prevent it from looking too large.

- [ ] **Task 4: Make the `SocialProof` Component Responsive**
    - [ ] **Sub-task 4.1:** Open `src/components/SocialProof/SocialProof.module.css`.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 4.2:** Add a media query for screens `768px` or less.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 4.3:** Target the logos' container. Change its `flex-direction` to `column` to stack the logos vertically. Alternatively, allow them to wrap using `flex-wrap: wrap;`. Stacking is often cleaner on very narrow screens. Add a `gap` to space them out.

- [ ] **Task 5: Make the `WhatsInside` Component Responsive**
    - [ ] **Sub-task 5.1:** Open `src/components/WhatsInside/WhatsInside.module.css`.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 5.2:** Add a media query for screens `768px` or less.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 5.3:** Target the main two-column container. Change its layout from two columns to a single column (`grid-template-columns: 1fr;` or `flex-direction: column;`) so the text block stacks on top of the image.

- [ ] **Task 6: Make the `Testimonials` Component Responsive**
    - [ ] **Sub-task 6.1:** Open `src/components/Testimonials/Testimonials.module.css`.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 6.2:** Add a media query for screens `768px` or less.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 6.3:** Target the container holding the two `TestimonialCard` components. Change its layout to a single column (`grid-template-columns: 1fr;` or `flex-direction: column;`) to stack the cards vertically.

- [ ] **Task 7: Make the `Author` Component Responsive**
    - [ ] **Sub-task 7.1:** Open `src/components/Author/Author.module.css`.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 7.2:** Add a media query for screens `768px` or less.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 7.3:** Target the main two-column container. Change its layout to a single column so the author's image stacks on top of their biography. Consider adding `text-align: center;` to this section on mobile.

- [ ] **Task 8: Final Testing**
    - [ ] **Sub-task 8.1:** Run the development server (`npm run dev`).
    - [ ] **Sub-task 8.2:** Open your browser's developer tools (usually F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).
    - [ ] **Sub-task 8.3:** Enter "Device Simulation" mode and test the page at various widths (e.g., iPhone 12, iPad, Galaxy S20).
    - [ ] **Sub-task 8.4:** Scroll through the entire page at each device width and check for any layout issues, text overflow, or elements that are too small to read or click. Make minor adjustments as needed.
