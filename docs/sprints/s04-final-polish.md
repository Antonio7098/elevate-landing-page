# Sprint #04: Finalization, Accessibility & Build Preparation

**Date Range:** 19 June 2025 - 20 June 2025
**Primary Focus:** Frontend - Quality Assurance, Accessibility (a11y), and Optimization
**Overview:** This final sprint takes the completed, responsive landing page and makes it production-ready. The focus is on replacing placeholder content, conducting a thorough accessibility audit to ensure the site is usable by everyone, optimizing assets, and creating a final production build.

## I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List

*Instructions for the engineer: This phase is about quality and polish. Pay close attention to detail. You will be revisiting most of the components to improve them, not just to change their layout.*

- [ ] **Task 1: Populate Final Content**
    - [ ] **Sub-task 1.1:** Go through every component (`Hero`, `WhatsInside`, `Testimonials`, `Author`, etc.) and replace all "Lorem Ipsum" placeholder text with the final, provided copy.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 1.2:** Replace all placeholder images and logos in the `src/assets` folder with the final, high-quality versions. Ensure the file names are updated in the corresponding components if they have changed.

- [ ] **Task 2: Conduct Accessibility (a11y) Audit & Fixes**
    - [ ] **Sub-task 2.1 (Semantic HTML):** Review the JSX in each component. Ensure you are using semantic tags where appropriate (e.g., `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<blockquote>`, `<main>`).
    - [ ] **Sub-task 2.2 (Alt Text):** Add descriptive `alt` text to every `<img>` tag to describe the image for screen readers and in case the image fails to load. This includes images in:
        - [ ] `Hero.jsx` (the book/tablet visual)
        - [ ] `SocialProof.jsx` (each company logo, e.g., `alt="Logo for Power Bull"`)
        - [ ] `WhatsInside.jsx` (the book content preview)
        - [ ] `TestimonialCard.jsx` (the person's photo, e.g., `alt="Headshot of Niff Button"`)
        - [ ] `Author.jsx` (the author's photo)
    - [ ] **Sub-task 2.3 (Form Labels):** In `Hero.jsx`, ensure the email `<input>` is properly associated with a `<label>`. For a clean design where the label is not visible, you can add a visually hidden class or use an `aria-label`.
        ```jsx
        <label htmlFor="emailInput" className={styles.visuallyHidden}>Email Address</label>
        <input id="emailInput" type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" aria-label="Email address for book download" />
        ```
    - [ ] **Sub-task 2.4 (Focus States):** Using your keyboard only, press the "Tab" key to navigate through the entire page. Ensure that every interactive element (links in the header, the email input, the CTA button) has a clear visual focus indicator (an outline). If not, add a `:focus-visible` style in the relevant CSS module.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 2.5 (Automated Check):** Install the "axe DevTools" browser extension. Run an automated accessibility scan on the page and review its report. Fix any critical or serious issues it identifies.

- [ ] **Task 3: Optimize Assets & Code**
    - [ ] **Sub-task 3.1 (Image Optimization):** Take all the final PNG/JPG images and run them through an online optimization tool like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/). Replace the original files in `src/assets` with these smaller, optimized versions to improve page load speed.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 3.2 (Code Cleanup):** Search the entire project (`.jsx` and `.js` files) for any leftover `console.log()` statements and remove them.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 3.3 (Add Comments):** Review your CSS modules. If you wrote any particularly complex or clever CSS (like a tricky grid or flexbox layout), add a short comment explaining what it does for future developers.

- [ ] **Task 4: Create Production Build**
    - [ ] **Sub-task 4.1:** Commit all your final changes to version control (Git).
    - [ ] **Sub-task 4.2:** In your terminal, run the production build command: `npm run build`.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 4.3:** Once the command finishes, observe that a new folder named `dist` has been created in your project's root directory. This folder contains the minified, optimized, and static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are ready to be deployed to a web server.
    - [ ] **Sub-task 4.4 (Optional):** To test the production build locally, you can run `npm run preview`. This will start a local server to serve the contents of the `dist` folder.
